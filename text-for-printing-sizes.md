### Strategy Recommendations for Maximus Vinyl Wrap

Since you are specializing in **Vinyl Wraps** and **Large Format Prints**, you should consider these specific e-store optimizations:

1. **The "Aspect Ratio" Filter**: Group your catalog by aspect ratio (e.g., **2:3 Ratio** includes 8x12, 16x24, 24x36). This helps the user select a size that matches their original image without cutting off important details.
2. **Vinyl Specifics**: For vinyl services, consider offering **Linear Foot** options or **Vehicle-Specific Kits** (e.g., "Full Hood Wrap - Standard Truck") in addition to these standard rectangular sizes.
3. **Lamination Upsell**: On your product page, always offer lamination (Matte vs. Gloss) as a required selection. For vinyl, this is crucial for UV protection and durability.
4. **Framing Accessibility**: Highlight that sizes like **8x10, 11x14, and 16x20** are "Easy-Frame" sizes. Customers are more likely to buy if they know they can get a cheap frame at a local store.

Building your catalog around industry-standard "Pre-defined sizes" is a smart move. It allows you to buy frames and shipping tubes in bulk, keeping your overhead low while ensuring customers can easily find retail frames for their prints.

Based on an analysis of leaders like **Vistaprint**, **Canvaspop**, and **Printful**, here are the top 10 most sold sizes divided by their primary use case.

### **Top 5 Sizes for Wall Decorations (Home & Office)**

These sizes dominate the "Wall Art" market because they fit the most common pre-made frames found at stores like IKEA, Target, or Michaels.

1. **24" x 36" (Large Statement)**: The gold standard for living rooms and offices. It has a 2:3 aspect ratio (same as most DSLR photos), making it the #1 choice for "hero" wall pieces.
2. **18" x 24" (Medium-Large)**: Extremely popular for gallery walls or bedrooms. It’s large enough to be a focal point but small enough to fit in tighter wall segments.
3. **16" x 20" (The Classic)**: The most popular mid-sized option. It has a 4:5 aspect ratio, which is the traditional "portrait" look.
4. **11" x 14" (Small-Medium)**: Ideal for office desks or hallway "collections." It is the largest size that still feels "personal" rather than "commercial."
5. **12" x 12" (Square)**: Driven by the "Instagram aesthetic," square prints are currently trending for modern minimalist decor and multi-panel wall sets.

### **Top 5 Sizes for Business Marketing & Ads**

These sizes are designed for high visibility, durability (if vinyl), and specific commercial placements.

6. **11" x 17" (Tabloid/Small Poster)**: The most popular size for indoor business ads. You’ll see these on bulletin boards, shop windows, and restaurant doors.
7. **22" x 28" (Retail Standard)**: Known as the "Standard Sign" size. This is what you see in the metal stanchion signs at malls, movie theaters, and bank lobbies.
8. **2' x 6' (Vertical Banner)**: The standard for trade show "X-banners" or sidewalk "A-frame" inserts. It’s perfect for listing services or menus.
9. **3' x 6' (The Universal Vinyl Banner)**: If a business is having a "Grand Opening" or a "Sale," this is almost always the size they buy. It fits perfectly on most storefronts and fences.
10. **4' x 8' (The Construction/Outdoor Giant)**: Used for site signs and large outdoor marketing. Because it matches the size of a standard sheet of plywood, it's the default for heavy-duty commercial vinyl.
